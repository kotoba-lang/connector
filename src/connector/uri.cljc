  "RFC 3986 percent-encoding and query strings, identical on every host.

  Separate from `connector.auth` because connectors need it too: a calendar id
  is `jun@example.com`, a Drive query is `name contains 'x'`, and both go into
  a URL. A connector that reached for the platform primitive would get a
  different answer on nbb than on the JVM.

  Neither primitive is RFC 3986 on its own. Java's URLEncoder is form-encoding
  (space becomes '+', '*' and '~' differ) and encodeURIComponent leaves !'()*
  alone. The rewrites below settle both on the same output."
