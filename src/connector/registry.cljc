  "Several connectors, seen as one surface.

  This is the piece the workspace did not have. Tools reached an agent by being
  written into it (`agent-control/available-tools` is a `cond->` over four
  hard-coded vectors), so adding an integration meant editing the application.
  A registry makes the set a value: build it from whichever connector
  repositories a deployment depends on, and the agent's tool list follows.

  Uniqueness is enforced rather than resolved. Two connectors offering a tool
  of the same name is not something to silently pick a winner for — the tool
  names are what a model sees, and a name that means different things in
  different deployments is worse than a load-time failure."
