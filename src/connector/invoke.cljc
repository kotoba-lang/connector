  "Run one tool call: build the request, attach the token, send it through the
  host's transport, normalize the response.

  The attaching is here rather than in each connector repository, and that is
  the load-bearing part of this namespace. A connector's `request` function is
  handed a tool name and arguments and returns a request map — it is never
  given a token, a keychain, an environment or a way to reach any of them. So
  a connector repository cannot leak a credential it has no way to obtain, and
  reviewing one does not require checking whether it did."

  Returns the normalized result, or an error map with `:connector/error true`.
  Errors are values rather than exceptions because every caller so far — an
  MCP dispatcher, an agent loop, a tool-result frame — has to turn a failure
  back into data anyway, and throwing only to catch is a longer way round.

  An HTTP status of 400 or above is not normalized. A connector's `normalize`
  is written against a success body; handing it an error payload produces a
  result that reads like an answer."
