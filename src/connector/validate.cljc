(ns connector.validate
  "Structural validation of a connector descriptor. Pure: returns a vector of
  problem maps `{:connector/severity :error|:warn :connector/code …
  :connector/id … :connector/msg …}` so a caller decides how to surface them.
  `valid?` is true iff there are no :error-level problems.

  Deliberately checks the two things a connector can get wrong silently:

    - a tool that declares no scopes. It looks fine, works during development
      under a broad grant somebody else requested, and fails at the provider
      the first time a host computes consent from the enabled set.
    - a repository name that does not follow from `:connector/origin-domain`.
      The origin plane is a mechanical function of the authority's real domain
      (ADR-2608040100), so a mismatch is a lookup that never happened."
