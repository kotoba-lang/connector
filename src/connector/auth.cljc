  "OAuth 2.0 authorization-code, as pure data.

  Every function here returns a URL string or a request map. None of them
  performs a request, reads an environment variable, generates randomness or
  hashes anything — those are the host's, and a library that did them would
  hold exactly the ambient authority a connector exists to avoid.

  PKCE follows from that: `code-challenge` takes the SHA-256 function as an
  argument. The workspace already has base64url SHA-256 in several places and
  none of them are portable .cljc; injecting it keeps this namespace loadable
  on nbb, in a browser and on the JVM without choosing one.

  The state parameter is the caller's too. It has to be — it is only worth
  anything if the same process that minted it checks it on the way back, and a
  library cannot do the second half."

  Scopes are sorted before joining. OAuth scope order is not significant

  the caller assembled it — which is what makes two consent URLs in a log
